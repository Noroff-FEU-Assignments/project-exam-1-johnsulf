## Description
puttingLAB Blog is my assignment for Project Exam 1 in my Front-end development studies at Noroff.
In short, the task was to create a blog where the front-end was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. WordPress should be used as a headless CMS to create blog content, and WordPress RestAPI to display blog content on the blog.

All blog post texts and images are created using ChatGPT.
